    "This report presents a comprehensive validation analysis of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used for economic regime identification. The validation encompasses model selection criteria, regime quality assessment, and economic validity testing. The analysis demonstrates that the 4-state HMM model achieves optimal performance with a 100% recession detection success rate and economically meaningful regime characteristics.\n",
