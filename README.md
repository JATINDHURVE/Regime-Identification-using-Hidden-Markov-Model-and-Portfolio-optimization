# üìà Regime-Based Portfolio Optimization Project

A comprehensive implementation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) regime identification and regime-aware portfolio optimization strategies for enhanced risk-adjusted returns.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated approach to portfolio management by:
1. **Identifying economic regimes** using Hidden Markov Models with leading economic indicators
2. **Optimizing portfolio allocations** dynamically based on the current economic regime
3. **Comparing performance** against traditional static portfolio optimization approaches

## üìä Key Features

- **HMM Regime Identification**: 4-state economic regime classification (Expansion, Recovery, Downturn, Slowdown)
- **Dynamic Portfolio Optimization**: Regime-specific Mean Variance Optimization (MVO)
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Statistical and economic validation of regime models
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed comparison of regime-based vs. traditional approaches
- **Real Economic Events**: Validation against known recession periods (1990s, Dot-com, Great Recession, COVID-19)

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Economic Regime Identification

**Input Features:**
- **VIX**: Market volatility index (fear gauge)
- **PMI**: Purchasing Managers' Index (economic activity)
- **Yield Curve**: 10Y-2Y Treasury spread (economic outlook)

**HMM Configuration:**
- 4 hidden states (optimal by BIC criteria)
- Gaussian emissions with full covariance
- Standardized features for numerical stability

**Regime Classification Logic:**
- **Expansion**: Highest PMI, lowest VIX (strong growth, low volatility)
- **Recovery**: High yield curve, moderate VIX (economic recovery phase)
- **Downturn**: Lowest PMI, highest VIX (recession/crisis periods)
- **Slowdown**: Moderate indicators (economic deceleration)

### 2. Portfolio Assets

**Asset Classes:**
- **EQU**: S&P 500 (Equities)
- **GOVT**: Treasury Bonds (Government bonds)
- **CORP**: Corporate Bonds
- **COMM**: Commodity Index
- **REITs**: Real Estate Investment Trusts

### 3. Optimization Framework

**Mean Variance Optimization (MVO):**
- Utility function: `U = Œº'w - (Œª/2)w'Œ£w`
- Risk aversion parameter: Œª ‚àà [1, 10]
- Dynamic bounds based on inverse volatility
- Regime-specific expected returns and covariance matrices

## üìà Key Results

### Model Validation
- ‚úÖ **Optimal Model Selection**: 4-state model chosen by BIC criteria
- ‚úÖ **High Regime Persistence**: 93.5% average persistence rate
- ‚úÖ **Economic Validity**: 100% recession detection success rate
- ‚úÖ **Realistic Duration**: Average regime length of 19.4 months

### Economic Event Validation
| Event | Period | Detected Regime | Accuracy |
|-------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Early 1990s Recession | 1990-1991 | Downturn (87.5%) | ‚úÖ |
| Dot-com Recession | 2001 | Downturn (100%) | ‚úÖ |
| Great Recession | 2007-2009 | Downturn (100%) | ‚úÖ |
| COVID Recession | 2020 | Slowdown (100%) | ‚úÖ |

### Regime Distribution (1990-2025)
- **Recovery**: 34.3% (12.1 years)
- **Expansion**: 31.9% (11.3 years)
- **Downturn**: 22.9% (8.1 years)
- **Slowdown**: 10.9% (3.8 years)
